Proxy is an interface for accessing a particular resource. (Same interface with a different behavior)
The resource may be remote or difficult to construct or require logging, security check or other functionality

Proxy -> identical interface, may not even work with materialized object
Decorator -> enhanced interface, typically aggregates or have reference to what it decorates
